      EpiFactors is a database for epigenetic factors, corresponding genes and products.

      Epigenetic factors are defined as:
      %ul
        %li
          Proteins that change the general structure of chromatin (chromatin remodeling), including
          %ul
            %li Proteins that act upon post-translational modifications of histones (histone modification read, write and erase);
            %li Proteins that move, eject or restructure nucleosomes (ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers);
            %li Proteins that incorporate histone variants into the nucleosomes.

          Specific subgroups of proteins may be annotated as such, e.g. the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins.

        %li Protein cofactors forming complexes with epigenetic factors, where complex formation is important for the activity (cofactor).
        %li Proteins acting as histones, histone variants or protamines (histone).

        %li Proteins assisting histone folding and assembly (histone chaperone).

        %li Proteins that act upon modifications of DNA or RNA in such a way that it affects gene expression, but not throught RNA processing (DNA or RNA modification).
        %li LncRNAs that are involved in epigenetic regulation by various mechanisms, including
        %ul
          %li Recruitment or sequestration of a chromatin modifiers;
          %li Chromatin loop formation by recruitment of looping factors or R-loop formation;
          %li Regulation of alternative splicing by modification, recruitment or sequestration of splicing factors, chromatin remodeling or R-loop formation;
          %li miRNA sequestration (sponging).
